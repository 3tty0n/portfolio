abstract: |-
    The advent of shape-adaptive computers, which consist of microscale devices that can
    wirelessly interconnect and dynamically reconfigure their shapes and functions, presents
    new challenges for software development. Existing programming environments and languages
    are not well-suited for managing the complex state interactions and asynchronous processes
    inherent in such systems. In response to these challenges, we propose the design and
    current status of MorphLang, a declarative programming
    language specifically designed for shape-adaptive computers. MorphLang abstracts the
    complexities of device interaction, enabling developers to focus on high-level behavior
    definitions without the need for intricate state management. Through a practical example,
    we demonstrate MorphLang's ability to handle dynamic node interactions effectively,
    paving the way for more efficient and innovative applications in shape-adaptive
    computing.
    Our approach not only simplifies the development process but also lays the
    groundwork for future advancements in this emerging field.
