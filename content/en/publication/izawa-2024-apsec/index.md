abstract: The advent of shape-adaptive computers, which consist of microscale devices
  that can  wirelessly interconnect and dynamically reconfigure their shapes and functions,
  presents new challenges for software development. Existing programming environments
  and languages are not well-suited for managing the complex state interactions and
  asynchronous processes inherent in such systems. In response to these challenges,
  we propose the design and current status of MorphLang, a declarative programming
  language specifically designed for shape-adaptive computers. MorphLang abstracts
  the complexities of device interaction, enabling developers to focus on high-level
  behavior  definitions without the need for intricate state management. Through a
  practical example, we demonstrate MorphLang's ability to handle dynamic node interactions
  effectively, paving the way for more efficient and innovative applications in shape-adaptive
  computing. Our approach not only simplifies the development process but also lays
  the groundwork for future advancements in this emerging field.
