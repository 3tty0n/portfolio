 abstract = {The advent of shape-adaptive computers, which consist of microscale
devices that can  wirelessly interconnect and dynamically
reconfigure their shapes and functions, presents new
challenges for software development. Existing programming
environments and languages are not well-suited for managing
the complex state interactions and asynchronous processes
inherent in such systems. In response to these challenges, we
propose the design and current status of MorphLang, a
declarative programming language specifically designed for
shape-adaptive computers. MorphLang abstracts the complexities
of device interaction, enabling developers to focus on
high-level behavior  definitions without the need for
intricate state management. Through a practical example, we
demonstrate MorphLang's ability to handle dynamic node
interactions effectively, paving the way for more efficient
and innovative applications in shape-adaptive computing. Our
approach not only simplifies the development process but also
lays the groundwork for future advancements in this emerging field.},
