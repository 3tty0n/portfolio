abstract: While applications of live programming are expanding to more practical and
  professional domains, most live programming environments (LPEs) are still developed
  for a single target language with an original code editor.  We propose an implementation
  framework for developing LPEs so that we can minimize efforts on implementing an
  LPE for a different target language and an existing code editor/IDE.  Our idea is
  to use a meta-JIT language implementation framework (e.g., Graal/Truffle and RPython)
  and LSP to separate core live programming implementations from language-specific
  and editor/IDE specific implementations.  This paper takes the Kanon live programming
  environment as a concrete example and discusses how we can design the framework
  to accommodate the features of Kanon.  Although the framework design is still underway,
  the paper presents a sketch of the framework APIs for separating language-specific
  functions and clarifies the requirements to LSP.
