abstract: Most virtual machines employ just-in-time (JIT) compilers to achieve high-performance.
  Trace-based compilation and method-based compilation are two major compilation strategies
  in JIT compilers. In general, the former excels in compiling programs with more
  in-depth method calls and more dynamic branches, while the latter is suitable for
  a wide range of programs. Some previous studies have suggested that each strategy
  has its advantages and disadvantages, and there is no clear winner.  In this paper,
  we present a new approach, namely, the meta-hybrid JIT compilation strategy. It
  combines trace-based and method-based compilations to utilize the advantages of
  both strategies. Moreover, it is realized as a meta JIT compiler framework; thus,
  we can generate a VM with a hybrid JIT compiler that can apply different program
  parts by merely writing an interpreter with our framework.  We chose to extend a
  meta-tracing JIT compiler and supported the two compilations on it. As a prototype,
  we implemented a simple meta-tracing JIT compiler framework called BacCaml based
  on the MinCaml compiler by following RPythonâ€™s architecture.  We evaluated its performance
  by creating a small functional programming language with BacCaml and running microbenchmark
  programs. Furthermore, we performed a synthetic experiment to confirm that there
  are programs that run faster by hybrid compilation.
