Meta-compiler frameworks can generate high-performance virtual
machines (VMs) from interpreter definitions. Despite the
success of frameworks such as RPython and Graal/Truffle,
creating multi-tier JIT compilation VMs within these
frameworks remains challenging. Traditional high-performance
VMs address this by using multiple  compilers that are
optimized for different trade-offs between compilation speed
and code quality. Replicating this structure in meta-compiler
frameworks, however, involves  substantial development effort.

We propose an approach, in the context of a meta-compiler framework, to adding a
lightweight compiler that takes a different compilation
strategy from an existing  heavyweight compiler without
requiring a new JIT compiler backend. By treating interpreter
definitions as not only specifications for language semantics but also as
compilation strategies, our approach enables RPython to
generate the essential components for a multi-tier JIT
compilation VM. We validate our approach with 2SOM, a
two-level compilation VM for Simple Object Machine. 2SOM
incorporates two JIT compilers: a tier-1 threaded code
generator that quickly produces subroutine threaded code for
warm-up phase, and tier-2 tracing JIT compiler that optimizes
frequently executed loops.  Our performance evaluation, using
a program with a realistic workload,  showed that 2SOM
improved warm-up performance by 15% from an RPython-based VM
in compensation for a peak performance reduction of merely
5%.
