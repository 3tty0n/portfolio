        I'm an assistant professor at Tokyo Metropolitan University.

        I work on a meta-compiler framework (a.k.a. language-implementation framework) such as RPython/PyPy and GraalVM/Truffle.

        I blog about programming language, virtual machine design and implementation, and software engineering.

        Please reach out to collaborate ðŸ˜ƒ
