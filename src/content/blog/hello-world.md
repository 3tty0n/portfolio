# Hello World

Welcome to my new portfolio site! I'm Yusuke Izawa, an assistant professor specializing in just-in-time compilation and meta-tracing compilers.

## What to expect

I'll be using this blog to share:

- Updates on my research in JIT compilation and meta-tracing
- Insights from working on compiler frameworks
- News about open positions in my research group
- Reflections on moving to Finland and starting a new chapter

Stay tuned for more posts!
